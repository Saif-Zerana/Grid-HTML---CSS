# testimonials-grid-section-main Project

## Overview
Welcome to my Project! 🎉 This project showcases my journey in web development and the skills I have acquired along the way. 

## Technologies Used
In this project, I have utilized the following technologies:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website.
- **CSS Grid**: For creating complex layouts easily.
- **CSS Flexbox**: For flexible and responsive layout structures.

## Project Highlights
- I challenged myself by not sticking to any predefined design and instead created the website from scratch.
- I chose the colors and design elements, stepping out of the conventional design box 🎨✨.
